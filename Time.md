## Time

---

	There’s always too much of it, when we dont want it and never enough when we do.

I often wonder what I would say to my younger self If I had the chance.

I think I would tell me to stop living like tomorrow never comes and start living to build a future.

To slow down and live in the moment and stop chasing the people who moved on from my life.  

  

All my life I’ve heard that “time heals everything” and it surely does indeed. Eventually. There is no quick solution to pain, loss, humility, etc, you heal when your heart and your soul finally come to agreement with each other.

Stop wasting time on people who make excuses or ignore you.

Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

Stop wasting time on things that don’t matter, especially when the things that do matter are right in front of you. Your friends, your lover, your children, all of the people who want nothing but your attention. The more you ignore and neglect those people, the less they will want anything from you.

Losing and failing doesnt make you a failure. Quitting does.

Hold yourself accountable and take responsibility for your actions.

Understand who you are, what you want and what you believe in, before you try to understand anyone else.

You can’t fix people, you can only try and guide them. Some people are on a sinking ship when you meet them. Don’t sink to the abyss with them, their baggage and trauma are not yours to carry.

All you can be is who you are. Nothing more, nothing less.
