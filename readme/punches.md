## Punches

>Just a reminder that life isn't about what's happened to you, it's about how you pick yourself up and keep going. We are NOT defined by our past, our struggles, or trauma. We are defined by what we choose to do with those things today and in the future. There's always a choice in everything we do and the sooner you accept the responsibility for those choices, the sooner you can grow and move forward
