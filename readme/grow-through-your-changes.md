# Grow Through Your Changes

***

> If you must change, change for the better. Don't change into someone you will grow to hate just to accommodate the person who claims to care about you. Some peoples genetics were infused with too much negativity. You could paint a canvas of all the great things they have in life and surround them with it and the only thing they will notice is how crooked the easel is or that the paint dripped onto the carpet.
