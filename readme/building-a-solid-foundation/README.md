## Questions

* Are you guided by passion or by corruption?
* Are you the person you want to be or did you become who you are because you follow what others wanted for you instead?
* Do you believe in change, or do you live ignorantly based on the false assumptions those before you had?
* These are questions you should stop and ask yourself because the answers to either side of these questions define who you are and who you have been.
* Only after giving some thought to them will you be able to change who you will become.

## Stay Who You Are

* Be the best friend you can be to those who care about you.
* Always continue to better yourself.
* Accept who you are and do the best you can, to love and take care of yourself.
* Last but not least. STOP looking for love, love will always find you.
