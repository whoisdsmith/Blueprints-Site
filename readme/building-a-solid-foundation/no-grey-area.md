* Are you guided by passion or by corruption?&#x20;
* Are you the person you want to be or did you become who you are because you followed what others wanted for you instead?
* Do you believe in change, or do you live ignorantly based oﬀ of the false assumptions those before you had?
* These are questions you should stop and ask yourself because the answers to either side of these questions deﬁne who you are and who you have been.
* Only after giving some thought to them will you be able to change who you will become.
