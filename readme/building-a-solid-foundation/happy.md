# Happy

***

> Happiness is not a place somewhere that you have to climb mountains and obstacles to get to, nor is it something that 99 you can only get from other people or the people you love. It's a decision you make every day. You have to understand that your unhappiness comes from continuing to make the decision to keep doing things that aren't good for your soul. Nobody is responsible for your own happiness but you, do what's good for you at all costs. Life is short and death is an open door waiting for you to walk through at any given moment.
