# Light Absorption

***

> There was a period of time, somewhere between early 2017 to early 2020 where shit got really dark. I didn't think things would ever get better, Most days I didn't want to get out of bed and I really wished I would fade out of existence. It was just after my son's 15th Birthday last year when I told myself and my mom that I'm going to get a job and out of my room and I'm going to make my life better. What I can say now is, somewhere in that darkness I found a light and that light grows brighter every day.
