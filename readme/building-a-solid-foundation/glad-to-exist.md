# Glad To Exist

***

**2021-08-24 7:37 AM**

> Happy to be here, thankful that others continued to see the things within me that I could not see in myself. Humbled that I got another chance to rewrite my story so it can be told in a more positive way someday. That's what's important, that's what matters, I didn't let my pain and struggles define me, I let them teach me that there's always a better way and that every mountain can be climbed if you just keep going.
