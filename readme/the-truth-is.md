# The Truth Is

***

* You never really heal from certain traumas.
  * They become a part of you forever.
* The only hope is that you don't become the people that hurt you.
  * It's not fair that they did what they did to you, but it's more unfair that you cause someone else the same trauma just because it was done to you.
* Know the difference.
  * Break the cycle or the cycle keeps repeating.
    * Year after year,
      * Generation to generation.

***
