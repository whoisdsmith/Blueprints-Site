# Decisions

***

```
I really want to write to inspire, I want to be known for something positive, someone who was able to help others who are going through some bad shit. 

For the last few years, I've been consumed with so much negativity and during that time I was unable to see the good things and the effects I had on people around me, most of all my children. 

I wish I had gotten myself out of that situation years ago, but I was so convinced I could change the situation's outcome. 

Towards the end of that relationship I was changing, I was becoming a better man by acknowledging my flaws and my mistakes, but sometimes it's just too late to save something that was always doomed from the start. 

Life can be so hard sometimes, especially when we are the ones who choose to make decisions that can come back and bite us in the ass.
