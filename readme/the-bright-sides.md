# The Bright Sides

***

> Do all things with love and passion, keep moving forward through the pain, through the rain, through every mountain in your way. Those are the things I'm reminded of every time I think about my father. It's what keeps me motivated and what keeps me in check when I'm not living the way he had shown. me. It's never too late to change, it's never too late to outgrow the people who don't bring the same positive energy in your life as you do and that includes family. Your might be connected by blood but there are people out there who are bonded to you by real love, people who will go to war and fight your demons with you. Instead of using them to hurt you. People who won't abandon you when you feel like giving up. People who still continue to show up even when it's inconvenient. People who don't want anything from you but your company.
