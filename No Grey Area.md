- Are you guided by passion or by corruption? Are you the person you want to be or did you become who you are because you follow what others wanted for you instead?  
- Do you believe in change, or do you live ignorantly based oﬀ of the false assumptions those before you had?  
- These are questions you should stop and ask yourself because the answers to either side of these questions deﬁne who you are and who you have been.  
- Only after giving some thought to them will you be able to change who you will become.
